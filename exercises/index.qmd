For each week I provide a set of exercises that help you to deepen your understanding of the covered topics. Try to solve the exercises on your own before reading the proposed solutions. Should there be any question, get in touch with your TA, post on Absalon, or discuss with your peers. You can also reach out to me during my office hours.
