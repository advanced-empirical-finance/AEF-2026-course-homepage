title: Technical prerequisites
--- 

Before we start working with R, Python, and Quarto in this course, please make sure you have installed all the required software. Follow the steps below to set up your working environment. Should you encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to contact your TAs or me for assistance. To facilitate collaboration, please ask me via the Absalon discussion board to make sure everyone can benefit from the solution.

1.  Install [R (Version \> 4.5.0)](https://cran.r-project.org/)

2.  Install [Python (Version \> 3.10.0)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3.  Install [Positron (latest Version)](https://positron.posit.co/start.html)
4.  Register a [free GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct)
5.  Install [Git] (https://git-scm.com/install/)
6.  Configure Git in Positron:
     - In Positron and open the source control view (`Ctrl+Shift+G)`
     - If Git is not installed, the Source Control view will show instructions on how to install it.
     - Once Git is up and running you can clone the course-repository by opening the source control view (`Ctrl+Shift+G)` and pressing `Clone Repository`. Then, you provide the course repository url [https://github.com/advanced-empirical-finance/course-repository.git](https://github.com/advanced-empirical-finance/course-repository.git) and choose a local folder where the repository should be stored. 

7. Open the cloned repository in Positron by navigating to `File` -> `Open Project` and selecting the folder where you cloned the repository.
8. To install *all* required R packages for the course, open the Terminal (`Ctrl+``) in Positron and install the `renv` package by typing the commands

        install.packages("renv")
        renv::restore()

You can install new packages, e.g., by calling `install.packages("tidymodels")´. To collaborate with your peers, just run `renv::snapshot()` to keep track of all the packages you use, and share the `renv.lock` file. Your colleagues only have to run `renv::restore()` to replicate your exact R package environment.

## Optional prerequisites

1. Install the newest version of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/download/). (Quarto comes prebundled with Positron, so you will have access to quarto once you followed the previous step)
1. In order to create PDFs you will need to install a recent distribution of LaTeX. I recomment to install `TinyTeX`, a lightweight, cross-platform, portable, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution by typing the command
  
          quarto install tool tinytex

in Positron / Terminal or directly in the console
